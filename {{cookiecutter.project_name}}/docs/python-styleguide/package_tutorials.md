## 1 Background

A tutorial is a step-by-step guide to a specific topic. It provides a clear and concise explanation of the topic,
demonstrating the functionality and use cases. It is designed to be self-contained and easy to follow.
However, the purpose of a tutorial is to not only educate users on functionality but also provide inspiration for new
approaches to solving problems.

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for creating effective Jupyter Notebook tutorials for Python packages.

It outlines best practices for structuring tutorials, defining the target audience, presenting code examples, formatting
content, and leveraging Jupyter Notebook features. These guidelines help developers create clear, accessible, and
educational tutorials that enable users to quickly understand and effectively use the packages, enhancing the overall
user experience and adoption of the project's components.


## 2 Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebooks are a powerful tool for creating interactive tutorials. They allow users to combine text, code, and
visualizations into a single document. They are ideal for educational purposes, as they provide a clear and concise
explanation of a topic, demonstrating the functionality and use cases.

When creating a tutorial, it is important to consider an report the following:
- **Kernel Choice:** Specify if needed.
- **Magic Commands:** Explain any used.


## 3 Directory Hierarchy

Tutorials should be organized in a directory structure that mirrors the package structure. This makes it easy for users
to find tutorials relevant to the specific components they're interested in.

- Each major package should have its own directory under the `tutorials/` directory
- Subpackages should have their own subdirectories when they contain multiple components
- Typically, there should be a single tutorial for each major package and subpackage, but there may be exceptions
- Filenames should start with descriptive name followed by `_package_tutorial` (e.g., `name_package_tutorial.py`)
- Use the format `<component_name>_package_tutorial.py` for individual component tutorials
- For tutorials that demonstrate multiple components working together, use a descriptive name that indicates the functionality being demonstrated, e.g., `caching_with_sentinel_tutorial.py`
- Use lowercase with underscores for file names (snake_case)

Example:
```
tutorials/
  bases/                          # Tutorials for the bases package
    collections/                  # Tutorials for the bases.collections subpackage
      collections_package_tutorial.py
    bases_package_tutorial.py
  cachingtools/                 # Tutorials for the cachingtools package
    cachingtools_package_tutorial.py
  baseobjects_package_tutorial.py
```

crucial to ensure that it is easy to follow and understand.


## 5.1 Define the Audience and Scope

**Target Audience:** The target audience will be the main user-base who be reading and using this tutorial.
- Typically, the tutorials' target audience will be those familiar with the Python Standard Library, popular packages,
  and possibly some of the dependencies.
- For packages, it should be assumed that the audience is familiar with the packages in the package and their
  dependencies.
- Depending on the goal of the tutorial, the target audience may be different.
- Tailor the language, complexity of examples, and depth of explanation to the intended audience.

**package Scope:** The scope clearly defines what this package does and what it *doesn't* do.
- Consider how does this tutorial fits into the understanding of the broader package.

**Prerequisites:** The requirements in knowledge and resources required to complete the tutorial.
- The concepts of the broader package that are used in the package.
- Any advanced or obscure concepts of the Python Standard Library used in the package.
- The concepts of the dependencies which are used in the package.
- Any resources the user needs to import.

The language used in package tutorials should be clear, accessible, and professional. Effective communication is crucial
for ensuring users can understand and implement the package's functionality. Follow these guidelines to maintain consistent
and user-friendly language throughout the tutorial:

- Polite, friendly, and approachable while still being clear, concise, and certain.
- Use simple, direct language. Avoid jargon where possible, or explain it if necessary.
- Keep sentences and paragraphs short.
- Use active voice.


### 5.3 Logical Flow

The logical flow of content is crucial for effective learning. A well-structured tutorial should progress naturally,
building upon previous concepts and maintaining a clear connection between topics.

- Organize topics from simple to complex.
- Ensure a smooth transition between sections.
- Each section should build upon the previous ones.


### 5.4 Markdown Cells

Markdown cells are essential for providing context, explanations, and documentation within the tutorial. They help break
up code sections, explain concepts, and guide users through the learning process. These cells should be well-formatted
and informative, making the tutorial easy to follow and understand.

- Introduce each code cell or group of related code cells with a Markdown cell.
- Explain the purpose of the code, not just a line-by-line translation.
- Use Markdown formatting (headings, lists, bold, italics, code highlighting) to improve readability.


### 5.5 Code Cells

Code cells are essential for demonstrating the functionality of the package. They provide a clear and concise way to
demonstrate the package's functionality and provide examples of how to use it.

- Every code cell must be runnable independently or in sequence.
- Ensure imports and variable initializations are correctly placed.
- Test all code cells thoroughly.
- Display Outputs: Ensure cell outputs are visible and illustrative.
- For plots, make sure they render correctly in the notebook.


### 5.6 Self-Contained Examples

Self-contained examples are crucial for ensuring that users can run and understand the tutorial without external
dependencies or setup requirements. These examples should be complete, runnable units of code that demonstrate specific
functionality while being independent of external resources. This approach makes the tutorial more accessible and
reduces potential points of failure.

- Avoid reliance on external files or services if possible. If necessary, provide clear instructions on how to
  obtain/set them up, or include mock data/objects directly in the notebook.
- For data, consider including a small CSV or generating data programmatically.
- If there are unit tests, use them as a reference but do not copy them exactly. The tutorial and examples should
  educate the user on how to use key aspects of the package and how they can use it to create new programs, not just
  test it.


### 5.7 Error Handling Examples

The Error Handling Examples section demonstrates how to handle common errors and exceptions that users might encounter
while working with the package. This section helps users understand potential pitfalls and how to gracefully handle
error conditions, making their code more robust and maintainable. It is optional, but recommended.

- Show how to handle common exceptions or invalid inputs if relevant to the package's usage.


## 6 Formatting and Style

This section provides specific formatting and style guidelines to ensure consistency and readability. These conventions
help create a professional and easily navigable document.


### 6.1 Headings

- Use `#` for the main title (H1).
- Use `##` for major sections (H2).
- Use `###` for sub-sections (H3), and so on.
- Be consistent with heading levels.


### 6.2 Code Blocks

- In Markdown cells, use backticks for inline code: `my_function()`.
- Use triple backticks for code blocks:
    ```python
    # Python code goes here
    ```
- Specify the language for syntax highlighting in Markdown code blocks (e.g., ` ```python`).


### 6.3 Emphasis

- Use `**bold**` for strong emphasis (e.g., key terms, warnings).
- Use `*italics*` for mild emphasis or for terms being defined.


### 6.4 Lists

- Use numbered lists for sequential steps.
- Use bulleted lists for non-sequential items or features.


### 6.5 Links

- Use descriptive text for hyperlinks:
    - Good: `[Read the full API documentation](link-to-docs)`
    - Avoid: `Click [here](link-to-docs)`


## 7 Tips for Effectiveness

This section provides practical recommendations for creating impactful and successful package tutorials. These tips help
ensure the tutorial achieves its educational goals while maintaining user engagement.

- **Start Simple:** Assume the user is a beginner with the package.
- **Build Complexity Gradually:** Don't overwhelm users with too much information at once.
- **Encourage Interaction:** Phrase explanations to invite users to try modifying the code.
- **Provide Context:** Explain *why* something is done, not just *how*.
- **Test Thoroughly:**
    - Run the entire notebook from start to finish in a clean kernel.
    - Have someone else go through the tutorial.
- **Keep it Updated:** As the package evolves, update the tutorial to reflect changes.
- **Clear Outputs Before Distribution (Usually):** Unless the outputs are essential for understanding without running (e.g., a complex plot that takes time to generate), it's often best to "Clear All Outputs" before distributing the `.ipynb` file. This reduces file size and allows users to generate outputs themselves. Alternatively, ensure all outputs are clean and directly relevant.

By following this style guide, developers can create high-quality Jupyter Notebook tutorials that significantly enhance the user experience for Python packages.
